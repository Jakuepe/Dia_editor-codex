# Diagram Editor

This project provides a simple diagram editor built with PyQt5. The original single-file implementation was split into modules for better maintainability.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyQt5

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running

Run the editor using:

```bash
python main.py
```

The application allows creating nodes, connecting them with edges and exporting the diagram as image or PDF.
